  <h2>What Iâ€™ve Built</h2>
  <p>From architecting scalable documentation systems to developing AI-integrated knowledge solutions, Iâ€™ve contributed to a wide range of impactful projects across the enterprise software landscape.</p>

  <p>Iâ€™ve led the end-to-end development of intelligent chatbot workflows using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, Azure AI Search, and Azure Open AI â€” all seamlessly integrated within a customized webpage. These solutions have dramatically improved self-service and internal support efficiency for global teams.</p>

  <p>My portfolio includes interactive help systems, user guides, and API references â€” all tailored for both technical and non-technical audiences. I enjoy blending usability, strategy, and storytelling to create content experiences that truly empower users.</p>

  <p>Iâ€™ve also designed and produced engaging video tutorials and product demos using tools like <strong>Camtasia</strong> and <strong>Adobe Creative Suite</strong>. These multimedia assets have been instrumental in simplifying complex concepts and enhancing user onboarding experiences.</p>
  <p>Beyond content delivery, Iâ€™ve built strong collaboration bridges between engineering, product, and business teams, ensuring that every solution I deliver is technically accurate, user-centric, and scalable.</p>
